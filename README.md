# Twitter

A php twitter clone. I tried using a mvc design strategy, 
you can be the judge on if it's true MVC or not (first time).

I have not bothered to censor database credentials as the 
database is only hosted locally, with a randomly generated password.

Commit messages may not always be as useful, this is just a personal
project of mine for school.
