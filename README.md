# Twitter

A php twitter clone. I tried using a mvc design strategy, 
you can be the judge on if it's true MVC or not (first time).
**This is just a personal repository for a school project.**

## Running the project

This project is designed to just be dumped in your wamp/lamp/whatever
server folder. If your folder path does not match this pattern: 
`/(\/srv\/http)|(C:\/wamp64\/www)/`, add your own to 
`public/index.php`.


## Database credentials

I have not bothered to censor database credentials as the 
database is only hosted locally, with a randomly generated password.

## Commit messages

Commit messages may not always be as useful, this is just a personal
project of mine for school.

## Comments

Some/most of the comments are in norwegian, as this will be 
submitted to my teacher (some are to myself as well).
